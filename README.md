# Fuzzy Logic Based Student Academic Performance Analyzing System

It is an analytical system for student academic performance based on fuzzy logic written in python programming language. The system uses fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and complexity in data. Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic; it deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact. In contrast with traditional logic theory, where binary sets have two-valued logic: true or false, fuzzy logic variables may have a truth value that ranges in degree between 0 and 1. Fuzzy logic has been extended to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false.

# To run this application in your system follow these steps:-

1. First clone the full GitHub repository in your system using the "git clone" command from your terminal.
2. Then navigate to the directory where you have cloned the repository using "cd" command from the terminal.
3.  In that cloned repository directory first run the "requirements.txt" file using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" on your terminal and install all the required packages and dependencies so that the application can run smoothly without any errors.
4. Then open the python file named "Fuzzy_Logic_Based_Student_Academic_Performance_Analyzing_System.py" in any of your favourite IDE and run the python code or you can also run the python code through your terminal using "python Fuzzy_Logic_Based_Student_Academic_Performance_Analyzing_System.py" command but keep in mind that while runnning the python code through the terminal you should be in that directory where that python code file is saved.
5. Your application is now successfully started.
